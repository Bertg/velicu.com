Progress on product development is going strong, and has hit the half way mark.

Some updates on product:

* We are glad to inform that after principal confirmation of Gender, we now also have visual confirmation.
* More detailed pictures of front facing features were desired. However product was not cooperating, and turning it's back when attempting to get visuals. Product Managers are happy to report that first character trait is identified, and it is in line with expectations.
